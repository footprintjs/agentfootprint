Defined in: [src/core/agent/window/types.ts:43](https://github.com/footprintjs/agentfootprint/blob/23dde4a00923eb3de0e6e5e6c26dbb8c0014797f/src/core/agent/window/types.ts#L43)

Why a turn refused to leave the window. Every one of these is NAMED in the
commit — a removal that took less than it could have has to say why, or the
next person debugging an oversized window has to guess.

The set is closed and shared: the same reason means the same thing under
every strategy, because every strategy resolves it through the same
function (`refusalFor`, bound into `WindowStrategyInput.planRemoval`).
