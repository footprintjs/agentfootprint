# Interface: FoldedConversation

Defined in: [src/core/agent/window/folded.ts:77](https://github.com/footprintjs/agentfootprint/blob/add0815e3417d934797433808004882c515e7ba6/src/core/agent/window/folded.ts#L77)

The smallest thing that can answer "what did this conversation fold?".

Structural rather than `AgentRunCheckpoint` on purpose: it also fits a
paused run's `conversation`, a hand-built fixture, and anything a consumer
pulled out of their own store — and it keeps this file from importing the
checkpoint module, which imports this one's sibling types.
