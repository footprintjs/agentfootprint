# Type Alias: ContextInjectedEvent

> **ContextInjectedEvent** = `AgentfootprintEventMap`\[`"agentfootprint.context.injected"`\]

Defined in: src/recorders/core/contextEngineering.ts:114

The shape of the event passed to `onEngineered` / `onBaseline`
callbacks. Same as `agentfootprint.context.injected`'s envelope —
we don't transform it, just route by source.
