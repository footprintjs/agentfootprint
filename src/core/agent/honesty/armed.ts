/**
 * honesty/armed — which honesty layers a run has armed: the ONE run constant.
 *
 * Pattern: a run constant, seeded once by `stages/seed.ts` (the
 *          `findingsServe` precedent) and never written again during the run.
 * Role:    core/ layer leaf. A reader of the RECORD — the standing fold, a
 *          lens, a bench — tells "this layer was armed and filed nothing" from
 *          "this layer was never armed" by this key alone, never by guessing
 *          from the rows.
 * Emits:   N/A.
 *
 * Absent on a run with no layer armed, so an agent that armed nothing commits
 * exactly the keys it always did.
