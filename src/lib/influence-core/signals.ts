/**
 * FDL influence signals — the four-signal composite from the Visible
 * Reasoning paper (Eq. 1–6), extracted verbatim as RFC-003 block D6.
 *
 * Pattern: pure scorer functions + one async orchestrator. Vector-level
 *          functions are deterministic and embedder-free; only
 *          `scoreInfluence` touches the injected `Embedder`.
 * Role:    `src/lib/influence-core/` leaf. Consumers: the FDL paper
 *          pipeline (stage 5, computeInfluenceScores), RFC-003 D7's
 *          LLM-edge weigher, and — one level up — RFC-002's margin
 *          scoring shares the same geometry via `margin.ts`.
 *
 * ## Honest claim per signal (RFC-002 §2 discipline)
 *
 * Every signal is embedding GEOMETRY — a deterministic proxy, not a
 * window into the model:
 *
 *  - FA      "the tool's output is semantically close to the final
 *            answer" — NOT "the answer was derived from it".
 *  - AVG     "the tool's output stayed semantically close to the
 *            reasoning steps" — NOT "the model kept consulting it".
 *  - PERSIST "many reasoning steps are similar to it above T" — breadth
 *            of apparent reference, NOT counted citations.
 *  - DEPTH   pure structure (1/(1+ancestors)) — directness of position
 *            in the trace, knows nothing about content at all.
 *
 * The composite S(d) means "high semantic alignment with the answer",
 * never "this source contributed X% of the answer" (paper §5.2: scores
 * are per-item, not additive, not causal attribution). Same inputs →
 * same scores, unlike LLM-as-judge.
